# BuyBuy_sales_Analysis

## Background

BuyBuy is an e-commerce platform that offers a wide range of products to their loyal customers. 
These products include accessories, bikes and clothing items. Of all of these, bikes are the highest
performing products sold. They account for over 60% of BuyBuy’s profits and 61.78million in gross 
revenue generated. However, the quantity of bikes sold makes up only 3% of all goods sold, compared 
to the accessories product category in which an outstanding 1.05million units have been sold, to 
generate a profit of 8.86million and 17% of all revenue. There is an enormous potential for growth 
under the bikes category of the business. The clothing category appears not be as lucrative as others, 
it has generated 2.84million from the sale of 254,740 clothes and accounts for just 9.8% of the
company’s revenue.

## Cost of production

In total, BuyBuy has had to invest 41.26million in their bikes product line and this is twice the amount
generated in profits. Furthermore, they invested 5.53million into their clothing branch, and had 
2.84million in profits. However, it would be wise to scale-up the accessories aspect of their business
as they have made almost 9million in profits compared to the initial investment of 6.26million.

## Business strategy 

At 7.77million, BuyBuy made the most profit from salesin California. This accounted for 70% of profits
from the company’s business dealings across 22 States in the US, and 24.12% of profits globally. Of
the 10 most profitable products sold, 7 of them are Bikes sold in California, Oregon, and Washington.
These 3 cities collectively are responsible for at least 99.6% of the company’s profits. The market in
these areas is obviously more receptive to these products, however, just a few units have been sold
till date.

## Recommendation

- BuyBuy should consider engaging market elements to increase the sales of bikes in the
under-performing cities to match sales in the 3 major cities. Although bike sales cost the
company a lot, they could invest more in advertising especially in the under-performing
cities across the US to stimulate demand. Consequently, this increased demand will require
an even massive spending to sustain.

- Priority should be given to strategies that will increase sales of accessories, because it is cost-effective for the business to increase their sales of accessories to customers than the other 2 product categories. For instance, more investment in advertising the products they have in 
their accessories category will result in an even greater customer interest, which will be
cheaper to maintain.

The bike products are in a high growth market but do not seemto have a high share of the market due
to the low quantity sold. One reason for this might be that the organization has not been able to 
create a significant position in that industry. Therefore, some questions need to be answered. What is 
the organization doing wrong? What are competitors doing right? Accessories fall under the **“Star 
Products”** because of the high market growth and rising demand. Star products generate a lot of 
income and have high sales volumes.

- BuyBuy will need to make considerable investments in order to differentiate the products in
their range of accessories from competitors in mature markets and grow brand awareness in
emerging markets.

Grouping the customers into ages bands namely, Youths (17-30), Young adults (31-45), Adults (46-60)
and Seniors (above 60), allows for an understanding of the customer reaction to different products.
Of the four customer segments, young adults lead in all three product categories, followed by the
youths, and the two groups account for 40 and 30million in total revenue respectively.

- The figures show that the opportunity that exists with the youth population is enormous.
Therefore, branding and advertising should be tailored towards capturing more of the youth
and young adult population.

- BuyBuy should promote customer loyalty among their adult and senior customers. This can
be achieved using means such as loyalty cards and discounts.
